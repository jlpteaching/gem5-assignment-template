# The gem5 assignment template repository

This repository is set up so that you can easily use it as a template repository for gem5-based assignments.

This repo contains all of the "general" requirements for gem5-based assignments.
For each assignment, you should create a *fork* of this repository with the template code needed for that particular assignment.

## Using this to create assignments

1. Fork this repository to an assignment-specific repository (e.g., "assign-1") under your classroom organization.
2. Add the new repository as a new remote (`git remote add assign-1 git@github.com:<organization>/assign-1`)
3. Create a new branch (e.g., `git branch -b assign-1`)
4. Set the correct upstream for this branch (`git branch --set-upstream-to=assign-1/main assign-1`)
5. Add the template python configuration files on this branch
6. Push to the new repository (`git push`).

## Using codespaces

I'll fill this in soon.
