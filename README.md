# The gem5 assignment template repository

This repository is set up so that you can easily use it as a template repository for gem5-based assignments.

## Using this to create assignments

1. Fork this repository to an assignment-specific repository (e.g., "assign-1") under your classroom organization.
2. Add the new repository as a new remote (`git remote add assign-1 git@github.com:<organization>/assign-1`)
3. Create a new branch (e.g., `git branch -b assign-1`)
4. Add the template python configuration files on this branch
5. Push to the new repository (`git push -u assign-1 main`). Make sure you push your branch named "assign-1" to the "main" branch of the new repository.

## Using codespaces

I'll fill this in soon.
